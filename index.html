        <h1>Project on <span id="con">Console</span></h1>
        <p>You can download Visual Studio on this link: <span id="linkvs">https://code.visualstudio.com/</span> When you are there, click on download. When it's done downloading, click it and keep clicking next then click install.
        </p>
        <p>The console screen is where your <strong>outputs</strong> go. If there is anything wrong with your code, it will show what is <strong>wrong</strong>. This is helpful for when you're coding or testing and something looks wrong. On the bottom of the visual studio screen, you have 4 tabs. Click output and you will see your console. There is a <span class="bluestuff">blue</span> bar at the very bottom of the window. In the <span class="bluestuff">blue</span> bar, there is a X symbol and a warning symbol on the left of the <span class="bluestuff">blue</span> bar. <strong>If the numbers beside it are 0, you have no problems in your code, if it's not you have a problem(s) in your code.</strong> To "print" something in the console, type console.log() and in the <strong>brackets</strong>, type what what you want to put in the console.</p>
